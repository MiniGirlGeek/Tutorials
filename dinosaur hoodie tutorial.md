  #Creating a Dinosaur Hoodie

  #What you'll need
  1. A hoodie
  2. An Adafruit Gemma
  3. Access to a 3D printer
  4. White NinjaFlex
  5. A needle
  6. **_optional_** A needle threader (useful if you've not done much sewing before)
  7. Some conductive thread
    * Silver based conductive thread is easier to work with (it's less springy) but will eventually oxidise.
    * Stainless steel conductive thread is harder to work with but will last for longer.
  7. 8 x Adafruit RGB NeoPixels
  8. A battery

  #3D Printing
  You can either attempt to draw your own spine, or you can use our design. Once you've got an .stl file ready
