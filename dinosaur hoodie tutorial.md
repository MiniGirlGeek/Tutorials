#Creating a Dinosaur Hoodie

#What you'll need
1. A hoodie
2. An Adafruit Gemma
3. Access to a 3D printer
4. White NinjaFlex
5. A needle
6. **_optional_** A needle threader (useful if you've not done much sewing before)
7. Some conductive thread
  * Silver based conductive thread is easier to work with (it's less springy) but will eventually oxidise.
  * Stainless steel conductive thread is harder to work with but will last for longer.
7. Normal thread
7. Crocodile clips _(for testing)_
7. 8 x Adafruit RGB NeoPixels
8. A battery

#3D Printing
You can either attempt to draw your own spine, or you can use [our design](https://github.com/MiniGirlGeek/Tutorials/blob/master/resources/dinosaur_spike.stl). Once you've got a .stl file ready you can start printing.

Each spine can take between 30mins - 1hr 30mins to print depending on your printer and settings.

Once you've started you can start the sewing, and start another spine printing as and when possible.

#Sewing Practice
If you haven't done much sewing before, it would be useful to have some practice. Otherwize skip to the [next section](#next-section)

This is the eye of a needle:

This is where you'll insert your thread.

1. Measure out a length of thread that is double the distance between the tip of your hand and your elbow.

1. If you're using a needle threader, you'll need to insert the threader through the eye of the needle first.

2. Next push your thread through the eye of the needle threader.

3. Now pull the needle threader out from the needles eye, and you should have a successfully threaded needle.
