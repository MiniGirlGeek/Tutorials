#Creating a Dinosaur Hoodie

#What you'll need
1. A hoodie
2. An Adafruit Gemma
3. Access to a 3D printer
4. White NinjaFlex
5. A needle
6. **_optional_** A needle threader (useful if you've not done much sewing before)
7. Some conductive thread
  * Silver based conductive thread is easier to work with (it's less springy) but will eventually oxidise.
  * Stainless steel conductive thread is harder to work with but will last for longer.
7. Normal thread
7. Crocodile clips _(for testing)_
7. 8 x Adafruit RGB NeoPixels
8. A battery

#3D Printing
You can either attempt to draw your own spine, or you can use ![our design][https://github.com/MiniGirlGeek/Tutorials/blob/master/resources/dinosaur_spike.stl]. Once you've got a .stl file ready you can start printing.

Each spine can take between 30mins - 1hr 30mins to print depending on your printer and settings.

Once you've started you can start the sewing, and start another spine printing as and when possible.

#Sewing Practice
If you haven't done much sewing before, it would be useful to have some practice.
1. Thread your needle
